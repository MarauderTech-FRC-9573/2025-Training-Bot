# 2025-Training Bot 
This is the programming certification project for MarauderTech 9573!
## Background
To use the knowledge you've learned about Java and WPILib, you will code a simple robot including commands, subsystems and controller bindings. 

The robot will have the following mechanisms: tank drivetrain, elevator, manipulator (to score coral). The robot should have at least 3 commands. 

The robot must also take in the input of a cotroller to move the elevator and score coral with the input of the controller. 

The elevator is run by 2 [SPARKMax motors](https://docs.revrobotics.com/revlib/spark/max-vs-flex). The manipulator is run by 1 [talon motor](https://api.ctr-electronics.com/phoenix6/release/java/com/ctre/phoenix6/hardware/TalonFX.html). 

If there is any encoder values that you need in your code, feel free to initialize it to a basic placeholder value. 

Commands are up to you, but recommendations are: changing the speed for the drivetrain, making the elevator go up and down manually, and shooting coral forward.
## Prequisites
* A Windows/Mac/Linux computer with [WPILib 2025](https://frcdocs.wpi.edu/en/latest/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html). An engineering room cmputer will work, but anything that involves the command line (building/deploying code) will not work 
* Access to the MarauderTech 9573 GitHub organization (post your username in the #programming channel if you do not yet have access)
